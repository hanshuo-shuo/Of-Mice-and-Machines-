Major Code for ICML 2025: Of Mice and Machines: A Comparison of Learning Between Real World Mice and RL Agents

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository contains code related to our ICML 2025 poster paper.  
Due to strong coupling between the implementation and our custom simulation environment, this code is **not intended to be used as a general-purpose or easily reproducible implementation**.

The mechanisms are provided for conceptual reference only.  
We do **not guarantee reproducibility of the paper's results out-of-the-box**, and the code may require significant adaptation to run in different settings.
